# Minecraft Avatars

This directory contains pixel-art style avatars for the Minecraft chat theme.

Default avatars available:
- steve.png - Default male character
- alex.png - Default female character  
- zombie.png - Zombie character
- skeleton.png - Skeleton character
- creeper.png - Creeper character
- enderman.png - Enderman character

These are placeholder files. In a production environment, you would add actual 32x32 pixel art images of Minecraft characters.

For now, the app will gracefully fallback to default placeholder images when these files are not found.
